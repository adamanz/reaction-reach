Subject: Re: Your reaction + DuploCloud's $32M Series B announcement

Hi Phil,

I noticed you reacted to my LinkedIn post about AI automation tools - thanks for engaging!

Congrats on DuploCloud's $32M Series B funding!

Given your role as Account Executive II at DuploCloud, I imagine the idea of building 20+ production AI agents in just 2 months caught your attention. Especially in the DevOps automation space.

At The Simple Company, we've been helping companies achieve remarkable results with AI automation:
• 97.1% accuracy in automated workflows
• 95% cost reduction compared to manual processes
• Multi-modal AI capabilities (text, voice, video, and memory)

I noticed DuploCloud is focused on simplifying cloud operations - we could build AI agents that automate your sales workflows with the same efficiency you bring to cloud infrastructure.

I'd love to show you how we could build similar AI solutions for DuploCloud - whether it's automating customer interactions, creating demo videos at scale, or streamlining your sales processes.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute demo this week? You can grab any time that works for you here:

## 📊 Tracking & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Email Sent Rate**: Successfully sent / Total attempted
2. **Open Rate**: Track via email platform
3. **Click Rate**: Clicks on cal.com/mystack link
4. **Booking Rate**: Demos scheduled / Emails sent
5. **Show Rate**: Demos attended / Demos scheduled
6. **Close Rate**: Deals closed / Demos attended

### Follow-up Sequences
```
Day 0: Initial outreach email
Day 3: Follow-up if no response
Day 7: Value-add content share
Day 14: Break-up email with easy out
```

## 🚀 Running the Automation

```bash
# One-time setup
cd /Users/adamanzuoni/ReactionReach
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run fresh extraction and send
python send_reaction_outreach.py

# Use existing reactions file
python send_reaction_outreach.py reactions_data_1752427924.json

# Dry run (preview without sending)
DRY_RUN=true python send_reaction_outreach.py
```

## ⚡ Quick Start Checklist

- [ ] Update `POST_CONTEXT` with your actual LinkedIn post details
- [ ] Set your `CALENDAR_LINK` to cal.com/mystack
- [ ] Configure sender details (name, title, company)
- [ ] Test with one email first
- [ ] Monitor calendar for bookings
- [ ] Track metrics in spreadsheet
- [ ] Iterate on subject lines based on open rates
- [ ] A/B test different CTAs

## 🔒 Best Practices

1. **Timing**: Send Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM recipient's timezone
2. **Volume**: Max 50 emails/day to maintain quality
3. **Personalization**: Always reference specific post content
4. **Follow-up**: 48-72 hours if no response
5. **Tracking**: Use UTM parameters on cal.com link

## 📈 Expected Results

Based on typical B2B outreach:
- Open Rate: 40-60% (LinkedIn connection boost)
- Click Rate: 15-25% (cal.com link)
- Booking Rate: 5-10% of sent emails
- Show Rate: 70-80% of bookings
- Close Rate: 20-30% of demos

## 🎯 Success Formula

```
Great Post Content
+ Timely Reaction Extraction  
+ Quality Email Enrichment
+ Personalized Outreach
+ Easy Booking Process
= Consistent Demo Pipeline
```
