Hi Robert,

I hope this email finds you well! I noticed you reacted to my recent LinkedIn post and wanted to reach out personally to thank you for the engagement.

I appreciate professionals who take time to engage with thoughtful content, and I'd value the opportunity to connect.

I'd love to learn more about your work and explore potential ways we might collaborate or share insights in our respective fields.

Since we're already connected on LinkedIn, I thought it would be great to take our professional relationship beyond the platform.

Would you be open to a brief coffee chat or video call in the coming weeks? I'm always interested in connecting with thoughtful professionals who engage with content that resonates with them.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

P.S. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn as well if we haven't already: [Your LinkedIn URL]
