# CrewAI Integration Notes for LinkedIn Reactions Extractor

## Summary

We successfully created a CrewAI project structure for the LinkedIn Reactions Extractor with:

1. **Multi-agent architecture**:
   - Navigator Agent: Handles LinkedIn navigation
   - Extractor Agent: Extracts reactor profile data
   - Reporter Agent: Generates reports

2. **Proper YAML configuration**:
   - `agents.yaml`: Defines agent roles, goals, and backstories
   - `tasks.yaml`: Defines tasks with clear instructions for StagehandTool usage

3. **CrewAI project structure**:
   - Used `crewai create crew linkedin_crew --skip_provider`
   - Installed dependencies with `crewai install`
   - Added stagehand-py integration

## Current Issues

### 1. StagehandTool Configuration Issue

The StagehandTool in crewai-tools has a mismatch between its expected configuration and the actual Stagehand Python SDK:

```python
# Error: "model_api_key is required to create a session"
```

The tool seems to expect a different initialization pattern than what's documented.

### 2. Package Confusion

- CrewAI's StagehandTool expects `stagehand-py` 
- But the initialization parameters don't match the current stagehand-py API
- The tool might be expecting an older version or different SDK

## Solutions

### Option 1: Custom Tool Wrapper

Create a custom tool that properly wraps stagehand-py:

```python
from crewai_tools import BaseTool
from stagehand import Stagehand
import os

class LinkedInStagehandTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "LinkedIn Browser Tool"
    description: str = "Navigate and extract data from LinkedIn"
    
    def _run(self, instruction: str, command_type: str = "act"):
        # Initialize Stagehand with proper parameters
        stagehand = Stagehand(
            api_key=os.getenv("BROWSERBASE_API_KEY"),
            project_id=os.getenv("BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID"),
            model_api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
        )
        
        # Execute based on command type
        if command_type == "act":
            return stagehand.act(instruction)
        elif command_type == "extract":
            return stagehand.extract(instruction)
        elif command_type == "observe":
            return stagehand.observe(instruction)
```

### Option 2: Direct Integration

Use the original `smart_linkedin_extractor.py` as a base and add CrewAI coordination on top, rather than trying to use the built-in StagehandTool.

### Option 3: Wait for Updates

The StagehandTool integration in crewai-tools might need updates to work with the current version of stagehand-py.

## Lessons Learned

1. **CrewAI Structure**: The framework provides excellent structure for multi-agent workflows
2. **Tool Integration**: Built-in tools may have version compatibility issues
3. **Custom Tools**: Creating custom tools might be more reliable for new integrations
4. **Environment Setup**: The `crewai create` command sets up a clean environment with proper dependency management

## Next Steps

1. Create a custom tool wrapper for Stagehand
2. Test the complete workflow with the custom tool
3. Consider contributing the working integration back to crewai-tools

## Working Files

- `crew.py`: Main crew definition with agents and tasks
- `agents.yaml`: Agent configurations
- `tasks.yaml`: Task definitions with StagehandTool instructions
- `main.py`: Entry point with environment variable handling

The CrewAI framework successfully orchestrates the agents and tasks, but the StagehandTool integration needs refinement to work with the current Browserbase/Stagehand ecosystem.
